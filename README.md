## Methodology

For Juno, Neta, Rac Stakers, Levana Egg Spirit Levels. We reassigned everyone with staked values of:

max(your stake, mean staked)

This is a way to put a cap on whales, and distrbute the overall slice more evenly across stakers. 
Bad for Whales, probably good for you. 

For NFT holders, holding many is equivalent to holding one in our methodology.
